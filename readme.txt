== Installation ==

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How are student accounts created? =

When adding a student who is not already a WordPress user, a new user account is created automatically. The username is set to the first initial of their first name concatenated with their last name and a string of digits (all lowercase). A random password is generated.

= Can I add existing WordPress users as students? =

Yes. Enter the user's existing username (user_login) when adding a student. If the username exists in the database, the user is added to the gradebook without changing their credentials.

= How do students view their grades? =

Students log in to WordPress and navigate to the GradeBook menu item. They will see only their own grades for courses they are enrolled in.

Existing data in pre-4.0 unprefixed tables will not be migrated automatically.

= 4.0.0 =
Major compatibility update. Database tables now use WordPress table prefixes. All AJAX endpoints are secured with nonces. Requires WordPress 6.0+ and PHP 7.4+.
